# Project 3 Prep

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is more narrow than a room. They are similar as they are both places for the player to walk through.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of 
drawing a knight world and randomly generating a world 
using rooms and hallways?**

Answer: The knight world are rooms, and all that needs to be done is connect the rooms together.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually 
get to the full knight world.**

Answer: Using the random seed we will take a random number between 1-3 which 1 will generate a room, 2 will generate
something else, and 3 will generate something else as well

**This question is open-ended. Write some classes 
and methods that might be useful for Project 3. Think 
about what helper methods and classes you used for the lab!**

Answer: create room, create hallway, create walls.
A wall class, maybe a hallway class
