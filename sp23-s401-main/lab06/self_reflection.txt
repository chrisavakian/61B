You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Creating the start size variable rather than cheesing the style checker.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: All the else statements to cover the edge cases because I did not use a for loop for the indices.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: How much more complicated my code is because I did not use the modulus operator to cycle through the indices.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: You can iterate through the indices using the modulus operator. Not doing that doubled the amount of code I had to write.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Nothing, because my code works. Although recoding it to use the mod operator would be really nice for efficiency reasons.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: That my solution was very similar to the staff solution, the logic was nearly identical.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Before Proj1c, I counted the sentinel node as part of the size. This caused errors in proj1c, so that had to change.
I also understood the idea of garbage collection, so whenever I removed a value, I understood exactly what was happening.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Nothing, this is most likely due to me taking a data structures course in Community College.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would not change anything about it, I think it is good, and it works.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: To be honest, my schedule, especially this week, did not allow for an easy fit for my lab time.
